# WaywardCraft
WaywardCraft is a mod that intends to bring the TV show Supernatural to Minecraft, including the ability to hunt monsters, ghosts, demons, angels, and even Leviathans!

Please note: this mod is still in the early stages of development and there is currently no timeline for when it will be released to the public. This file will be updated with a list of every feature that I manage to fully incorporate into the mod (which as of now is zero) as soon as I am happy with a feature.

Another note: I (Linky132) currently reserve all rights to this project simply to ease my ridiculously irrational anxieties that someone will come along and steal my hard work. As soon as WaywardCraft is released (possibly even before that), the license for this project will be changed either to the MIT license or to a custom license. I hope you understand.
